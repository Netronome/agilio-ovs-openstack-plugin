# Sample ``local.sh`` for user-configurable tasks to run automatically
# at the successful conclusion of ``stack.sh``.

# NOTE: Copy this file to the root DevStack directory for it to work properly.

# This is a collection of some of the things we have found to be useful to run
# after ``stack.sh`` to tweak the OpenStack configuration that DevStack produces.
# These should be considered as samples and are unsupported DevStack code.
